Starting point was JGH's disassembly of the Electron MOS 1.00 here:
https://mdfs.net/Info/Comp/Acorn/Source/MOS.htm

There are various copies of the ROM available. I went with the one
here: https://acorn.huininga.nl/pub/unsorted/roms/Electron-OS__1.00 -
the first I found with what looks like an uncorrupted copy of the
credits text hidden behind the I/O area. (The other parts of the ROM
are identical to the other copies I found.)
